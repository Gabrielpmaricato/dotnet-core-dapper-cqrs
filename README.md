# Example .NET Core app using CQ(R)S with Dapper

This small .NET Solution shows how to implement CQS pattern with good separation of concerns.

Some of the advantages of using a solution like this instead of other ways of implementing the pattern are:
- No GOD command and query objects
- Easy dependency injection
- Only ONE component is needed to be injected and used to execute ANY command
- Only ONE component is needed to be injected nad used to execute ANY query

## Main Components

We have SIX main components that allow us to do all of this.
